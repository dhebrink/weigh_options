# Weigh Options
This application is intended to help people build a list of questions or prompts to answer when attempting to come to an important decision. Users would build a template of configurable questions of varying "answer types" to then copy and fill out per decision option.

For example:
* Person wants to buy a new truck
* Person builds a Template with a list of questions to consider when evaluating each specific vehicle model
* Each question could be answered via drop-down selection, yes/no choice, or free-form text
* Once the list of questions are built in the template, copies of the template are created to be filled out per vehicle model
  * Copy for each Toyota, Dodge, Ford, etc.
* Answers are provided within each copy and stored for later comparison

The customization ability should allow for templates to be categorized, built, and used for any kind of purpose. The templates could be stored per user, or globally accessible such that any template created by one user could be reused by someone else that may be going through a similar choice.
